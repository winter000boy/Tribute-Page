                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu). His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi.
                    <br>
                Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading goods and transporting passengers between the Indian mainland and the Pamban island and to and from Sri Lanka. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge connecting Pamban island to mainland India in 1914, the businesses failed. As a result, apart from the ancestral home, the other family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, and the family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy, he delivered newspapers to support the family's meager income.
